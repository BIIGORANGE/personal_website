            Something I wanted to work on here. I feel when writing this down originally, I didn't necessarily use the correct words or explain myself in the way I wanted to.

                One thing I don't think I've ever written about or considered is feeling like I don't know what I'm doing. I tend to give up when I feel like I don't know what I'm doing.

            Wow wtf? I think what I was trying to convey was the feeling of struggling. Struggling with something new. Working through that feeling of incompetence to reach competence(on some level).

            I want to be clear in direction, that's what I meant by "supposed to be easy". For example, solving a multiplation worksheet is a straightfoward process: <br>
            1. Know how to multiply <br>
            2. Find a problem and solve <br>
            3. Move to the next problem <br>
            4. Repeat <br>
            </p>
            <p>
            What I was trying to say in the paragraph above is that, when you know how to multply, you have a clear and perfectly understandable goal and methods to achieve that goal. But when you don't even know how to add, where do you go from there? That's what's hard about it. Not knowing how to do the problem in the first place feels overwhelming. That learning process can really get to a point of pure struggle, but that struggle means something. It means progress. Like building a muscle, it means tearing and shredding shit apart and rebuilding over and over. In that meaning, the "satisfaction" comes from; or a better way to say that is "fulfillment" comes from meaning. That progress. Now I just need to figure out what progess means in this conext.<br>

            I think I meant it as moving towards certain goals. For me, it's been learning how to code. That's why I made this website in the first place, I want to have a personal website were I just write HTML/CSS and hopefully learn JavaScript along the way. I don't feel paticularly creative, because I'm not sure what my limitations are. And most of the time, websites need content to be able to do anything with them. I'm slowly coming up with more and more ideas to add to this paticular website, but I would also like to take a step away from worrying about content and more about functionality. I just need to come up with what I'd like to create first. Either way, I still feel that when I write like this, I'm making progress towards my goals. Getting more and more comfortable using HTML.

            I used the word "Persistence" a couple of times in this writing. Main idea I can gather is a task/project can engage the mind/body in a way nothing else can. But this engangment can easily be broken if there is an interruption to that task/project. For example, not understanding a problem can derail your task. It's persistence that makes it possible to learn through that. Since the task is difficult, the main thing that's going to get you through it is persistance. And without persistence, there is no consistency. Without consitency, there is no learning.
